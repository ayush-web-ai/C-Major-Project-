# C-Major-Project-

## Description
In this project, I created a Harry Potter–themed quiz game using the C programming language. The program asks the user multiple-choice questions related to Harry Potter and keeps track of their score based on the answers. I used the following C programming concepts and commands: standard input and output functions like printf() and scanf(), if-else statements, loop, Variables, etc
At the end, the program displays the total score and a message like “You’re a true wizard!” or “Better luck next time, Muggle!” based on the user’s performance.

## Getting Started
When you run the program, you will be shown a series of multiple-choice Harry Potter questions. Each question has numbered options. To answer, simply type the serial number of the option you think is correct and press Enter. Your responses will be checked, and your score will be updated as you progress through the quiz.

## Build Instructions
1. Download or clone the repository to your computer.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt and go inside the project folder.
3. Compile the program.
4. If the compilation is successful, you will see an output file named trivia (or trivia.exe on Windows).
